# Ranges

ranges is a library to iterate over some ranges that I found useful while coding.
I've been inspired by @bradfitz with its [iter](https://github.com/bradfitz/iter) library, even though it is a joke in the first place.

## Period

The first one was about iterating between 2 dates at a certain period.

I'm sure I'm gonna find some more, but that's it for nowâ€¦
